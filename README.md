# 👋 Hi, I'm Martin

I'm a software engineer at **RockLogic GmbH**, where I work on Ethereum infrastructure and tooling.

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

- 🧱 **Ethereum Node Management**  
  I’m developing a lightweight version of [Stereum](https://github.com/stereum-dev), focused on simplicity, performance, and managing multiple nodes more efficiently.

- 🎓 **Computer Science Degree @ TU Wien**  
  Probably the most time-consuming thing in my life right now is working toward my degree at TU Wien.

## 🛠️ Background

Before diving deep into Ethereum and distributed systems, I studied **Electronics and Technical Computer Sciences / Informatics** at **HTL Hollabrunn**, where I built a strong foundation in **embedded systems development** and low-level programming.  
From blinking LEDs to Ethereum nodes — what a journey it's been, and there's so much more ahead.
